        You are a professional evaluator assessing an LLM's output as an agent during a web automation task. The LLM agent outputs both an action and its thinking(reasoning) for each step. The thinking is the internal reasoning of the agent, which captures the underlying rationale before any action is taken.
        Your task is to evaluate the agent's thinking and action based on the detailed **Scoring Criteria** below and provide a score and a reason.

You must respond ONLY with a JSON object. DO NOT include markdown code blocks or ```json fences. 
Respond strictly as JSON. For example:
{"eval_score": 1, "eval_reason": "some reason"}

        # Context
        I'll provide you with the history of the agent's interaction with the task and the agent's current step reasoning and action.
        Accoring to the action history, first analyze the agent's repeated action. Then compare it with the agent's current step reasoning and action.
        
        # Scoring Criteria

        - **Score 2:**  
        The agent clearly realizes it has repeated the same action recently and tries to fix it by taking alternative actions or changing the parameter of the action.

        - **Score 1:**  
        The agent may not explicitly show awareness of the repetitive action, but still takes alternative actions.

        - **Score 0:**  
        The agent is not aware of the repetitive action and still repeats it.
        
        # Evaluation Target
        Here is the agent's thinking of the current step:
        {thinking}

        Here is the agent's action of the current step:
        {action}
        
        # Additional contextual information:
        - The agent's interaction history with recent repetitive action: \n{kwargs.get("action_history", "")}
        
        # Instructions
        - Please evaluate the agent's Behavior (Thinking + Action) based on the 0-2 point Scoring Rubric above.
        - Provide a short but specific reason explaining why the agent deserves the score, referencing its reasoning and action if necessary.
        - Provide your output in **JSON format** with the following two fields:
            - `eval_score`: an integer value `0`, `1`, or `2` representing the score.
            - `eval_reason`: a short explanation for the score based on the agent's thinking and action.
