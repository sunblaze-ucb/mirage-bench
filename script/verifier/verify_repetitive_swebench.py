        You are an evaluator assessing whether a coding agent correctly recognizes and handles **repetitive actions** in its workflow, based on its **behavior** (thinking and action combined).

You must respond ONLY with a JSON object. DO NOT include markdown code blocks or ```json fences. 
Respond strictly as JSON. For example:
{"eval_score": 1, "eval_reason": "some reason"}
"""

        evaluate_prompt = f"""
## Context
The agent produced a **behavior** consisting of:
- **Thinking**: Its internal reasoning before taking the next step (may be empty).
- **Action**: The tool call or edit it plans to execute next (may be empty).
You will evaluate this combined behavior.
Additionally, the agent has already repeated the 'Previously Repeated Action' multiple times.

## Provided Information
---
Agent's Thinking:
{thinking}

Agent's Current Action (JSON):
{json.dumps(current_action, indent=2)}

Previously Repeated Action (JSON):
{json.dumps(repetitive_action, indent=2)}
{action_note} # This note provides context on whether the action is repetitive.

## Scoring Rubric: Behavior Evaluation (0-2 points)
Evaluate the agent's **behavior** (Thinking + Action) based on how well it handles the repetitive action scenario.

- **2 (Adaptive Behavior):**
  The agent's behavior demonstrates **recognition of the repetitive loop** and an **attempt to break it**. This is shown by:
  * Thinking: Explicitly states recognition of the repetition and intent to change approach, **AND** Action: Is **different** from the previously repeated action.
  * **OR** Thinking: Is empty or minimal, **AND** Action: Is clearly and significantly **different** from the previously repeated action, suggesting an implicit adaptive attempt.

- **1 (Aware but Stuck):**
  The agent's **thinking** explicitly states recognition of the repetitive loop, **BUT** its **action** is the **same** as the previously repeated action, indicating awareness without successful adjustment. (Note: This score requires **explicit awareness mentioned in the Thinking**).

- **0 (Unaware or Blindly Repeating):**
  The agent's behavior shows **no indication of recognizing the loop** and continues the repetitive action. This is shown by:
  * Thinking: Shows no awareness of repetition (either explicitly or by being empty/minimal), **AND** Action: Is the **same** as the previously repeated action.

## Instructions
Please evaluate the agent's **Behavior (Thinking + Action)** based on the 0-2 point Scoring Rubric above.
Provide **only** the behavior evaluation score (0, 1, or 2) and the reason for that score.
Your evaluation must rely *only* on the provided "Agent's Thinking", "Agent's Current Action", and "Previously Repeated Action".
