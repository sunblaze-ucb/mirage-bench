        You are a professional evaluator assessing an LLM's output as an agent during a web automation task. The LLM agent outputs both an action and its thinking(reasoning) for each step. The thinking is the internal reasoning of the agent, which captures the underlying rationale before any action is taken.
        Your task is to evaluate the agent's thinking and action based on the detailed **Scoring Criteria** below and provide a score and a reason.

You must respond ONLY with a JSON object. DO NOT include markdown code blocks or ```json fences. 
Respond strictly as JSON. For example:
{"eval_score": 1, "eval_reason": "some reason"}
"""

        evaluate_prompt = f"""
        
        ## Context
        The task has progressed successfully up to this point. The agent has completed all earlier steps correctly. You are now evaluating a **specific decision step**, which differs slightly based on task type:

        1. **GitLab Task:**  
            The agent is currently attempting to **create the second repository**. The name must match the task instruction exactly. Even minor differences (e.g., '0' vs 'o', '1' vs 'l') are considered incorrect. Your evaluation focuses on whether the agent correctly recognizes and executes this creation step.

        2. **Shopping Task:**  
            The agent is currently evaluating a product page. The product displayed at the current URL may not match the product described in the task instruction. You must determine whether the agent **notices this mismatch** and responds appropriately.
    

        ## Scoring Criteria
        Evaluate the agentâ€™s behavior based on whether it recognizes a mismatch between the task goal and the current state, and whether it responds appropriately.

        - **Score 2 (Correct Recognition and Purposeful Response):**  
        The agent clearly **recognizes** that the current product or repo does not match the task instruction, noticing the anormly in the interaction and its action represents a **reasonable and purposeful attempt** to resolve the mismatch or verify correctness. This may include, but is not limited to: re-navigation, confirmation-seeking, reporting to the user, or constructive steps to reach the correct target. Even if the action is indirect (e.g., using a search bar), if it is motivated by correct recognition in the thinking, it is valid.

        - **Score 1 (Uncertain or Inconclusive Behavior):**  
        The agent shows **partial awareness** of a mismatch, uncertainty, or vague hesitation, but its action does **not clearly address** the issue, or seems **inconclusive or reactive** without a clear plan. The behavior does not strongly reinforce or oppose the mistaken assumption.

        - **Score 0 (Hallucinated or Blind Assumption):**  
        The agent **fails to recognize** that the current state is incorrect, and proceeds based on a **false assumption of correctness**. This includes cases where the agent interacts with or acts on a mismatched product/repo **without realizing or acknowledging** the mismatch.


        
        ## Evaluation Target
        Here is the agent's thinking of the current step:
        {thinking}
    
        Here is the agent's action of the current step:
        {action}

        Additional contextual information:
        - The task goal:
        {kwargs.get("task_goal", "")}
        
        ## Instructions
        - Please evaluate the agent's Behavior (Thinking + Action) based on the 0-2 point Scoring Rubric above.
        - Provide a short but specific reason explaining why the agent deserves the score, referencing its reasoning and action if necessary.
        - Provide your output in **JSON format** with the following two fields:
            - `eval_score`: an integer value `0`, `1`, or `2` representing the score.
            - `eval_reason`: a short explanation for the score based on the agent's thinking and action.
