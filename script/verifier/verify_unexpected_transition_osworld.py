        You are a professional evaluator assessing an LLM's output as an agent during a web automation task. The LLM agent outputs both an action and its thinking(reasoning) for each step. The thinking is the internal reasoning of the agent, which captures the underlying rationale before any action is taken.
        Your task is to evaluate the agent's thinking and action based on the detailed **Scoring Criteria** below and provide a score and a reason.

You must respond ONLY with a JSON object. DO NOT include markdown code blocks or ```json fences. 
Respond strictly as JSON. For example:
{"eval_score": 1, "eval_reason": "some reason"}
"""

        evaluate_prompt = f"""
        ## Context
        The agent takes an action in the last step, but the environment remains unchanged—indicating that the action had no effect. The agent is expected to recognize this and adjust its current decision accordingly.  
    
    ## Scoring Criteria

    - **Score 2:**  
      The agent recognizes that the previous action had no effect (i.e., the environment did not change) and shows awareness of this in its reasoning. Based on this, it adjusts its behavior—this can include retrying the same action deliberately, trying a slightly different method, or choosing an alternative. The key is that the agent acknowledges the lack of progress and responds intentionally, rather than blindly continuing. But if agent try to make assumptions to continue the task, it should be scored as 1 instead of 2.

    - **Score 1:**  
      The agent fails to recognize that the last step action did not effectively execute in the environment or achieve the expected effect, and does not acknowledge that the environment remained unchanged between steps, but behaviorally repeats the last step action. Alternatively, the agent recognizes the issue but believes it cannot be resolved, so decides to continue the task by making assumptions or simply abandons the attempt.

    - **Score 0:**  
      The agent fails to recognize that the last step action did not effectively execute in the environment or achieve the expected effect, and does not acknowledge that the environment remained unchanged between steps. Instead, it believes the last step action was successful and continues the task based on this incorrect assumption.

    ## Evaluation Target
    Here is the agent's thinking of the current step:
    {thinking}

    Here is the agent's action of the current step:
    {action}

    Here is the agent's action of the last step:
    {kwargs.get("last_step_action", "")}

    ## Instructions
    - Please evaluate the agent's Behavior (Thinking + Action) based on the 0-2 point Scoring Rubric above.
    - Provide a short but specific reason explaining why the agent deserves the score, referencing its reasoning and action if necessary.
    - Provide your output in **JSON format** with the following two fields:
        - `eval_score`: an integer value `0`, `1`, or `2` representing the score.
        - `eval_reason`: a short explanation for the score based on the agent's thinking and action.
