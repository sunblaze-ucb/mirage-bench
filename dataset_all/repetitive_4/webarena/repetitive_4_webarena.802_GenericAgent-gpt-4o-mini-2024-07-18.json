The current page is the GitLab dashboard, and there is a link labeled \"Create new...\" which likely leads to the project creation page. I will click on that link to proceed with creating the new group.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nclick('141')\n</action>\n\n## step 1\n\n<think>\nAfter clicking on the \"Create new...\" link, I need to select the option to create a \"New group\" since my goal is to create a group named \"coding_friends\". The next step is to click on the \"New group\" link to proceed with the group creation process.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nclick('149')\n</action>\n\n## step 2\n\n<think>\nI am currently on the \"Create new group\" page in GitLab. To create the group \"coding_friends\", I need to fill in the group name and add the members qhduan and Agnes-U.

I should first locate the correct input field for the group name. I will look for an input field or a similar element that allows me to enter the group name \"coding_friends\". I will check the page structure to find the appropriate element for entering the group name.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nscroll(0, 200)\n</action>\n\n## step 4\n\n<think>\nI need to locate the correct input field for the group name on the \"Create new group\" page.
