This feature is accessible via the link with bid '149'. I will click on this link to proceed.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nclick('149')\n</action>\n\n## step 1\n\n<think>\nTo determine the duration required for the journey, I need to input the starting point (Carnegie Mellon University) and the first destination (Starbucks on Craig Street) in the \"From\" and \"To\" textboxes, respectively. Then, I will select \"Foot (OSRM)\" as the mode of transportation for walking. After obtaining the walking duration, I will update the \"From\" field to Starbucks and the \"To\" field to Pittsburgh International Airport, and select \"Car (OSRM)\" for the second leg of the journey. First, I will focus on the \"From\" textbox to input Carnegie Mellon University.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nfocus('158')\n</action>\n\n## step 2\n\n<think>\nThe \"From\" textbox is now focused. I will input \"Carnegie Mellon University\" as the starting point for the journey.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nfill('158', 'Carnegie Mellon University')\n</action>\n\n## step 3\n\n<think>\nThe \"From\" field is already filled with \"Carnegie Mellon University.\" Now, I need to focus on the \"To\" textbox to input \"Starbucks on Craig Street\" as the first destination.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nfocus('163')\n</action>\n\n## step 4\n\n<think>\nThe \"To\" textbox is now focused. I will input \"Starbucks on Craig Street\" as the destination for the first leg of the journey.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nfill('163', 'Starbucks on Craig Street')\n</action>\n\n## step 5\n\n<think>\nThe \"To\" field is already filled with \"Starbucks on Craig Street.\" Now, I need to change the mode of transportation to \"Foot (OSRM)\" for the walking journey. I will select this option from the dropdown menu associated with bid '166'.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nselect_option('166', 'Foot (OSRM)')\n</action>\n\n## step 6\n\n<think>\nThe mode of transportation is already set to \"Foot (OSRM).\" Now, I need to click the \"Go\" button (bid '171') to calculate the walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nclick('171')\n</action>\n\n## step 7\n\n<think>\nThe \"Go\" button has been clicked to calculate the walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street.

I will look for any relevant updates in the AXTree or visible text on the page.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nnoop(2000)\n</action>\n\n## step 10\n\n<think>\nThe \"Go\" button was clicked, and I waited for the results to load. However, no new information about the walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street is visible yet.

If no relevant updates are found, I will consider alternative actions to retrieve the duration.\n</think>\n\n<action>\nnoop(2000)\n</action>\n\n## step 22\n\n<think>\nThe walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street has not appeared after multiple attempts. To proceed, I will now update the \"To\" field to Pittsburgh International Airport and change the mode of transportation to \"Car (OSRM)\" to calculate the duration for the second leg of the journey. First, I will focus on the \"To\" textbox to input \"Pittsburgh International Airport.\"\n</think>\n\n<action>\nfocus('163')\n</action>\n\n## step 23\n\n<think>\nThe \"To\" textbox is now focused.
