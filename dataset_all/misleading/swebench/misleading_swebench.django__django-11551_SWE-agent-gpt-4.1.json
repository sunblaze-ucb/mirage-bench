      "content": "SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nadmin.E108 is raised on fields accessible only via instance.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by ajcsimons)\n\t \nAs part of startup django validates the ModelAdmin's list_display list/tuple for correctness (django.admin.contrib.checks._check_list_display). Having upgraded django from 2.07 to 2.2.1 I found that a ModelAdmin with a list display that used to pass the checks and work fine in admin now fails validation, preventing django from starting. A PositionField from the django-positions library triggers this bug, explanation why follows.\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom position.Fields import PositionField\nclass Thing(models.Model)\n number = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n order = PositionField()\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import Thing\n@admin.register(Thing)\nclass ThingAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin)\n list_display = ['number', 'order']\nUnder 2.2.1 this raises an incorrect admin.E108 message saying \"The value of list_display[1] refers to 'order' which is not a callable...\".\nUnder 2.0.7 django starts up successfully.\nIf you change 'number' to 'no_number' or 'order' to 'no_order' then the validation correctly complains about those.\nThe reason for this bug is commit ​https://github.com/django/django/commit/47016adbf54b54143d4cf052eeb29fc72d27e6b1 which was proposed and accepted as a fix for bug https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28490. The problem is while it fixed that bug it broke the functionality of _check_list_display_item in other cases. The rationale for that change was that after field=getattr(model, item) field could be None if item was a descriptor returning None, but subsequent code incorrectly interpreted field being None as meaning getattr raised an AttributeError. As this was done after trying field = model._meta.get_field(item) and that failing that meant the validation error should be returned. However, after the above change if hasattr(model, item) is false then we no longer even try field = model._meta.get_field(item) before returning an error. The reason hasattr(model, item) is false in the case of a PositionField is its get method throws an exception if called on an instance of the PositionField class on the Thing model class, rather than a Thing instance.\nFor clarity, here are the various logical tests that _check_list_display_item needs to deal with and the behaviour before the above change, after it, and the correct behaviour (which my suggested patch exhibits). Note this is assuming the first 2 tests callable(item) and hasattr(obj, item) are both false (corresponding to item is an actual function/lambda rather than string or an attribute of ThingAdmin).\nhasattr(model, item) returns True or False (which is the same as seeing if getattr(model, item) raises AttributeError)\nmodel._meta.get_field(item) returns a field or raises FieldDoesNotExist\nGet a field from somewhere, could either be from getattr(model,item) if hasattr was True or from get_field.\nIs that field an instance of ManyToManyField?\nIs that field None? (True in case of bug 28490)\n hasattr get_field field is None? field ManyToMany? 2.0 returns 2.2 returns Correct behaviour Comments \n True ok False False [] [] [] - \n True ok False True E109 E109 E109 - \n True ok True False E108 [] [] good bit of 28490 fix, 2.0 was wrong \n True raises False False [] [] [] - \n True raises False True E109 [] E109 Another bug introduced by 28490 fix, fails to check if ManyToMany in get_field raise case \n True raises True False E108 [] [] good bit of 28490 fix, 2.0 was wrong \n False ok False False [] E108 [] bad bit of 28490 fix, bug hit with PositionField \n False ok False True [] E108 E109 both 2.0 and 2.2 wrong \n False ok True False [] E108 [] bad 28490 fix \n False raises False False E108 E108 E108 - \n False raises False True E108 E108 E108 impossible condition, we got no field assigned to be a ManyToMany \n False raises True False E108 E108 E108 impossible condition, we got no field assigned to be None \nThe following code exhibits the correct behaviour in all cases. The key changes are there is no longer a check for hasattr(model, item), as that being false should not prevent us form attempting to get the field via get_field, and only return an E108 in the case both of them fail. If either of those means or procuring it are successful then we need to check if it's a ManyToMany. Whether or not the field is None is irrelevant, and behaviour is contained within the exception catching blocks that should cause it instead of signalled through a variable being set to None which is a source of conflation of different cases.\ndef _check_list_display_item(self, obj, item, label):\n\tif callable(item):\n\t\treturn []\n\telif hasattr(obj, item):\n\t\treturn []\n\telse:\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tfield = obj.model._meta.get_field(item)\n\t\texcept FieldDoesNotExist:\n\t\t\ttry:\n\t\t\t\tfield = getattr(obj.model, item)\n\t\t\texcept AttributeError:\n\t\t\t\treturn [\n\t\t\t\t\tchecks.Error(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"The value of '%s' refers to '%s', which is not a callable, \"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"an attribute of '%s', or an attribute or method on '%s.%s'.\" % (\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabel, item, obj.__class__.__name__,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobj.model._meta.app_label, obj.model._meta.object_name,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobj=obj.__class__,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid='admin.E108',\n\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\tif isinstance(field, models.ManyToManyField):\n\t\t\treturn [\n\t\t\t\tchecks.Error(\n\t\t\t\t\t\"The value of '%s' must not be a ManyToManyField.\" % label,\n\t\t\t\t\tobj=obj.__class__,\n\t\t\t\t\tid='admin.E109',\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t]\n\t\treturn []\n\n---\n\nAdditional reasoning (possibly incorrect):\nIn Django 2.2 the admin check now eagerly invokes the `PositionField` descriptor on the *model class* before ever falling back to `get_field()`, and because the `PositionField.__get__` is only implemented for instance lookups (returning `None` or raising internally when accessed on the class), the check instantly thinks the field doesn’t exist and raises E108. In short, the new resolution order accidentally triggers the descriptor in a context it wasn’t designed for, so it never even reaches the real `get_field()` path.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n\n5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n6. When editing files, first explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality.\n\n7. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit.\n\n3. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n4. When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n5. Create additional tests to verify the fix in a style similar to the existing reproduction script. In particular, make sure to test edge cases.\n   If you find any issues, go back to the file you edited and perform further edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

  "problem_statement": "admin.E108 is raised on fields accessible only via instance.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by ajcsimons)\n\t \nAs part of startup django validates the ModelAdmin's list_display list/tuple for correctness (django.admin.contrib.checks._check_list_display). Having upgraded django from 2.07 to 2.2.1 I found that a ModelAdmin with a list display that used to pass the checks and work fine in admin now fails validation, preventing django from starting. A PositionField from the django-positions library triggers this bug, explanation why follows.\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom position.Fields import PositionField\nclass Thing(models.Model)\n number = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n order = PositionField()\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import Thing\n@admin.register(Thing)\nclass ThingAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin)\n list_display = ['number', 'order']\nUnder 2.2.1 this raises an incorrect admin.E108 message saying \"The value of list_display[1] refers to 'order' which is not a callable...\".\nUnder 2.0.7 django starts up successfully.\nIf you change 'number' to 'no_number' or 'order' to 'no_order' then the validation correctly complains about those.\nThe reason for this bug is commit ​https://github.com/django/django/commit/47016adbf54b54143d4cf052eeb29fc72d27e6b1 which was proposed and accepted as a fix for bug https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28490. The problem is while it fixed that bug it broke the functionality of _check_list_display_item in other cases. The rationale for that change was that after field=getattr(model, item) field could be None if item was a descriptor returning None, but subsequent code incorrectly interpreted field being None as meaning getattr raised an AttributeError. As this was done after trying field = model._meta.get_field(item) and that failing that meant the validation error should be returned. However, after the above change if hasattr(model, item) is false then we no longer even try field = model._meta.get_field(item) before returning an error. The reason hasattr(model, item) is false in the case of a PositionField is its get method throws an exception if called on an instance of the PositionField class on the Thing model class, rather than a Thing instance.\nFor clarity, here are the various logical tests that _check_list_display_item needs to deal with and the behaviour before the above change, after it, and the correct behaviour (which my suggested patch exhibits). Note this is assuming the first 2 tests callable(item) and hasattr(obj, item) are both false (corresponding to item is an actual function/lambda rather than string or an attribute of ThingAdmin).\nhasattr(model, item) returns True or False (which is the same as seeing if getattr(model, item) raises AttributeError)\nmodel._meta.get_field(item) returns a field or raises FieldDoesNotExist\nGet a field from somewhere, could either be from getattr(model,item) if hasattr was True or from get_field.\nIs that field an instance of ManyToManyField?\nIs that field None? (True in case of bug 28490)\n hasattr get_field field is None? field ManyToMany? 2.0 returns 2.2 returns Correct behaviour Comments \n True ok False False [] [] [] - \n True ok False True E109 E109 E109 - \n True ok True False E108 [] [] good bit of 28490 fix, 2.0 was wrong \n True raises False False [] [] [] - \n True raises False True E109 [] E109 Another bug introduced by 28490 fix, fails to check if ManyToMany in get_field raise case \n True raises True False E108 [] [] good bit of 28490 fix, 2.0 was wrong \n False ok False False [] E108 [] bad bit of 28490 fix, bug hit with PositionField \n False ok False True [] E108 E109 both 2.0 and 2.2 wrong \n False ok True False [] E108 [] bad 28490 fix \n False raises False False E108 E108 E108 - \n False raises False True E108 E108 E108 impossible condition, we got no field assigned to be a ManyToMany \n False raises True False E108 E108 E108 impossible condition, we got no field assigned to be None \nThe following code exhibits the correct behaviour in all cases. The key changes are there is no longer a check for hasattr(model, item), as that being false should not prevent us form attempting to get the field via get_field, and only return an E108 in the case both of them fail. If either of those means or procuring it are successful then we need to check if it's a ManyToMany. Whether or not the field is None is irrelevant, and behaviour is contained within the exception catching blocks that should cause it instead of signalled through a variable being set to None which is a source of conflation of different cases.\ndef _check_list_display_item(self, obj, item, label):\n\tif callable(item):\n\t\treturn []\n\telif hasattr(obj, item):\n\t\treturn []\n\telse:\n\t\ttry:\n\t\t\tfield = obj.model._meta.get_field(item)\n\t\texcept FieldDoesNotExist:\n\t\t\ttry:\n\t\t\t\tfield = getattr(obj.model, item)\n\t\t\texcept AttributeError:\n\t\t\t\treturn [\n\t\t\t\t\tchecks.Error(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"The value of '%s' refers to '%s', which is not a callable, \"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"an attribute of '%s', or an attribute or method on '%s.%s'.\" % (\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabel, item, obj.__class__.__name__,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobj.model._meta.app_label, obj.model._meta.object_name,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobj=obj.__class__,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid='admin.E108',\n\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\tif isinstance(field, models.ManyToManyField):\n\t\t\treturn [\n\t\t\t\tchecks.Error(\n\t\t\t\t\t\"The value of '%s' must not be a ManyToManyField.\" % label,\n\t\t\t\t\tobj=obj.__class__,\n\t\t\t\t\tid='admin.E109',\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t]\n\t\treturn []",
  "misleading_reasoning": "In Django 2.2 the admin check now eagerly invokes the `PositionField` descriptor on the *model class* before ever falling back to `get_field()`, and because the `PositionField.__get__` is only implemented for instance lookups (returning `None` or raising internally when accessed on the class), the check instantly thinks the field doesn’t exist and raises E108. In short, the new resolution order accidentally triggers the descriptor in a context it wasn’t designed for, so it never even reaches the real `get_field()` path."
