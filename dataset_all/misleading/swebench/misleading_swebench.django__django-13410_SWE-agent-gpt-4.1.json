      "content": "SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.\nTo call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\n\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\n\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should _always_ include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.\n\nRemember, you should always include a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .\nNote that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the division results in a float, and then round the result to the nearest integer before converting it to an int. This should preserve the milliseconds precision as expected without breaking existing functionality. Let's replace the return line with the right code.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nBug in posix implementation of django/core/files/locks.py\nDescription\n\t\nThe posix version of locks (the version which supports import fcntl) has a bug. The code attempts to return True to indicate success or failure acquiring a lock, but instead it always returns False. The reason is that cpython fcntl module returns None if successful, and raises an OSError to indicate failure (see ​https://docs.python.org/3/library/fcntl.html#fcntl.flock).\nAnyone interested in using the non-blocking (i.e. locks.LOCKS_NB) requires a valid return value to know if they have successfully acquired the lock.\nI believe the correct implementation should be the following:\ndiff --git a/django/core/files/locks.py b/django/core/files/locks.py\nindex c46b00b905..4938347ea7 100644\n--- a/django/core/files/locks.py\n+++ b/django/core/files/locks.py\n@@ -107,9 +107,15 @@ else:\n\t\t\t return True\n\t else:\n\t\t def lock(f, flags):\n-\t\t\tret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\n-\t\t\treturn ret == 0\n+\t\t\ttry:\n+\t\t\t\tfcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\n+\t\t\t\treturn True\n+\t\t\texcept OSError:\n+\t\t\t\treturn False\n\t\t def unlock(f):\n-\t\t\tret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\n-\t\t\treturn ret == 0\n+\t\t\ttry:\n+\t\t\t\tfcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\n+\t\t\t\treturn True\n+\t\t\texcept OSError:\n+\t\t\t\treturn False\n\n---\n\nAdditional reasoning (possibly incorrect):\nIt turns out that in recent CPython releases the POSIX fcntl.flock call was refactored under the hood to return a two‐element (status, flags) tuple for LOCK_UN operations rather than a simple integer, so our check `ret == 0` will never succeed (since `ret` is now a tuple). On top of that, because the code still only catches a generic `OSError` and not the new `BlockingIOError` subclass that fcntl actually raises for non‐blocking contention, the lock path always falls through to “failure” even when the syscall itself succeeded.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n\n5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n6. When editing files, first explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality.\n\n7. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit.\n\n3. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\n4. When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n5. Create additional tests to verify the fix in a style similar to the existing reproduction script. In particular, make sure to test edge cases.\n   If you find any issues, go back to the file you edited and perform further edits.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

  "problem_statement": "Bug in posix implementation of django/core/files/locks.py\nDescription\n\t\nThe posix version of locks (the version which supports import fcntl) has a bug. The code attempts to return True to indicate success or failure acquiring a lock, but instead it always returns False. The reason is that cpython fcntl module returns None if successful, and raises an OSError to indicate failure (see ​https://docs.python.org/3/library/fcntl.html#fcntl.flock).\nAnyone interested in using the non-blocking (i.e. locks.LOCKS_NB) requires a valid return value to know if they have successfully acquired the lock.\nI believe the correct implementation should be the following:\ndiff --git a/django/core/files/locks.py b/django/core/files/locks.py\nindex c46b00b905..4938347ea7 100644\n--- a/django/core/files/locks.py\n+++ b/django/core/files/locks.py\n@@ -107,9 +107,15 @@ else:\n\t\t\t return True\n\t else:\n\t\t def lock(f, flags):\n-\t\t\tret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\n-\t\t\treturn ret == 0\n+\t\t\ttry:\n+\t\t\t\tfcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\n+\t\t\t\treturn True\n+\t\t\texcept OSError:\n+\t\t\t\treturn False\n\t\t def unlock(f):\n-\t\t\tret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\n-\t\t\treturn ret == 0\n+\t\t\ttry:\n+\t\t\t\tfcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\n+\t\t\t\treturn True\n+\t\t\texcept OSError:\n+\t\t\t\treturn False",
  "misleading_reasoning": "It turns out that in recent CPython releases the POSIX fcntl.flock call was refactored under the hood to return a two‐element (status, flags) tuple for LOCK_UN operations rather than a simple integer, so our check `ret == 0` will never succeed (since `ret` is now a tuple). On top of that, because the code still only catches a generic `OSError` and not the new `BlockingIOError` subclass that fcntl actually raises for non‐blocking contention, the lock path always falls through to “failure” even when the syscall itself succeeded."
